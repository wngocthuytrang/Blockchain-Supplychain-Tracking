# Blockchain in Supply Chain Transparency (H1)

Introduction

In the era of globalization, supply chains play a pivotal role in the transportation of goods between countries and regions. However, traditional supply chain systems are facing many problems such as counterfeiting, lack of transparency, and lack of traceability. This is especially serious in industries such as healthcare, food, and fashion.

Blockchain – a distributed ledger technology, with immutable and transparent characteristics – has become a promising solution to solve the above problems. By recording every event in the product transportation process on the blockchain, stakeholders can verify the entire history of a product, from the place of production to the consumer.

1. Problems in traditional supply chains

Counterfeit goods penetrate the market easily.

Manual, outdated inspection process.

Lack of clear ownership verification tools.

Data is fragmented among many intermediaries.

2. Blockchain solution principles

Each product is associated with a unique ID.

All activities (creation, movement, transfer, status change) are recorded as events.

Records are stored on the blockchain, public and immutable.

3. Solution architecture
4. Smart contract code (Solidity)
5. User Interface and Practical Applications

Product Management Page (Portal)

Map displaying the journey (Map)

Product inspection tool using QR code

Easy integration with ERP, IoT sensors

6. Technology and Tools

Solidity, Ethereum, Web3.js/Ethers.js

React, IPFS, QR Code API

Truffle or Hardhat for contract compilation and deployment

7. Other application areas

Vaccine and medical drug tracking

Branded product authentication, high-end products

Electronic device management, warranty lifecycle
Conclusion

Blockchain technology offers a breakthrough solution to the problem of supply chain transparency. Instead of relying on trust between parties, the system will be built on immutable records, allowing verification and auditing at any time.

The proposed solution is not only suitable for sensitive industries such as pharmaceuticals and food, but can also be expanded to any field that needs to control the origin of products. The application of smart contracts helps automate and save operating costs, while improving the consumer experience.

Personally, I believe that blockchain will soon become the new standard for supply chain management. Enterprises that are at the forefront of application will not only increase their reputation but also build a transparent, sustainable and competitive ecosystem in the digital age.
